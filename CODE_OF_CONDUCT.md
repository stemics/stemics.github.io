# STEMICS Community Code of Conduct

### Domains and their structures

* We have taken our organization model from FreeBSD and OpenBSD, but we are following OpenBSD model for software development, especially the approach to the software security issues.
* Therefore we have three layers in every organization, core team, committers and contributors. So lets get started writing their roles and why we want that organization model.

### Core Team

* As we understand from software, it should be done in a short time and it should be done well and simple, maybe in 5 minutes or 30 minutes. Core Team is responsible from maintaining all information database in the domain and subdomains. So Core Team can delete any harmful information such as malware code/binary or any kind of information that includes a hate speech, racism and sexism. It is very important for us to learn from other organizations. So we are curious to learn other Free Software and Open Source code of conduct standards written before us.

### Committers

* Committers are mid-level or experienced developers in domain and subdomains or any information/content authors which has the right to add/commit information to our information database. We are a freely, open and collaborative company so we believe in free speech/freedom of speech and we are happy to get feedback and contributions from committers within our domain, subdomains or the people who is **not** working with us directly.

### Contributors

* Contributors are newcomers to our domain and subdomains so we want to take care of their skills and abilities, such as how they do useful things for **public**. We want to encourage committers and contributors to make their own services, communities and companies for the same reason to serve to the **public**.

### Our Core Values

* freedom of speech
* openness
* collaborative working
* privacy of community members
